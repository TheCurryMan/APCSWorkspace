/**
 * Each individual component of a number
 * 
 * Write a digit class that represents a single digit with a given base. The
 * digit class has two constructors. The default constructor sets the base at 10
 * and the value to 0. The other constructor accepts a decimal value and a base.
 * Create a toString method and an increment method. The increment method should
 * return a boolean: true if there is a carry and false if not.
 * 
 * For both classes, you can assume that the bases are restricted to binary,
 * octal, decimal or hexadecimal and the values are non-negative.
